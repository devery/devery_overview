## Project Overview 

***Devery*** is a product verification platform that aims to provide toolsets and frameworks to allow verfication applications to be built with ease using blockchain tecnology. The project is currently built upon the Ethereum network and as such utilises Ethereum's Solidity as the base layer of the protocol. 

We aim to foster the use of these projects utilising our native token, EVE, which is needed for functionality within our platform and forms fuel for the verification layer.  Where indicated, products have been open-sourced to foster adoption around decentralised verification applications and build an ecosystem of verification applications around the Devery protocol.


## Want to try Devery?

Visit the website at [Devery.io](https://devery.io/) to learn more or use our JavaScript framework held [here](https://devery.github.io/deveryjs). The list of repositories with all our current products can be found below.


## Open-Source Repositories

Our underlying protocol is open source and you can view, edit, and contribute via our Github. These repositories form the basis of our interaction on the blockchain and are used within the entirety of our further product suite. These are shown below: 

***[DeveryJS](https://devery.github.io/deveryjs)*** - The Devery Javascript library for Node.js allowing users to interact with the blockchain. This is completely documented and can be used via npm or visited here. 

***[Devery Contracts](https://github.com/devery/devery_contracts)***  - These contracts form the core of the protocol on the Ethereum network. They consist of Smart Contracts written in Solidity and powered via EVE. 

***Web of Trust*** - This allows vouching for keys on the Ethereum network.

***[EVE token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x923108a439c4e8c2315c4f6521e5ce95b44e9b4c)*** - Our native EVE token lives on the Ethereum network. 


## Devery Applications

Devery applications were built to demonstrate the flexibility of our protocol and demonstrate supply chain applications. These products aim to demonstrate the real world use case of our technology. They are shown below and will be available via the website and the Android/App store. 

***[Devery Mobile Application](https://github.com/devery/mobile_releases)*** - A mobile application that allows the reading of our marked products on the blockchain. It also enables the transfer of product ownership providing product provenance after purchase. 

***Devery Product Marking Application (in development)*** - A visual marking application that allows the marking of products on the blockchain. 

***Devery NFC Mobile Writer (in development)*** - An application that allows the writing to NFC tags using our marking application.

***Chain of Custody Application (internal testing)*** - An application which is used for projects such as the WFP. This enables chain of custody tracking to ensure transparent tracking of deliveries. 


## Third Party Applications

If you're interested in utilising our protocol whilst working with us directly, you can contact us [here](https://devery.io/contact). We welcome all contributors that wish to improve the ecosystem around decentralised applications. Our aim is utilising the Devery Protocol and actively looking to support projects that aim to build decentralised verification applications.


## Whitepaper

Devery.io's Devery Protocol is a decentralized verification platform that enables marking and tracking over the Ethereum network.  The protocol allows manufacturers, brands, retailers and any other party to assign unique signatures to any products, services or digital goods sold, issued and traded online. 

Our whitepaper can be found [here](https://devery.io/whitepaper/Devery_Whitepaper_rev5.pdf).
